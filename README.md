# PVU-Marketplace-Discord-Bot

A Discord Bot which captures pending transactions from Binance Smart Chain's API that looks for the Contract Address of PVU's Marketplace (once its validated by the validators that meant that the Plant is listed on the Marketplace). The Bot then notifies the discord server when it captures a filtered transaction. This gives users heads up and allows them to wait at the Plant's page for the "Buy" button to show up, or they can use QuickBuy without needing to wait for the button to show and front-run everyone (except Bots).
